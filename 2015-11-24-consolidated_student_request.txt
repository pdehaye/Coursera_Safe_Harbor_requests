Subject: Access and Notice under US-{EU/CH} Safe Harbor as Coursera student

Dear Coursera Representative,

My name is Paul-Olivier Dehaye, I am a {Belgian citizen/resident of Zurich, Switzerland}. I have an account on the Coursera website associated to the email address xxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com . 

I have used the Coursera platform as a student since late 2012. Since January 2014, Coursera has agreed to comply to the self-regulatory data protection framework called US-[EU/CH] Safe Harbor, to be enforced by the FTC [1, where I in fact found your email address]. This framework encompasses seven principles [2], and is meant to offer equivalent protection to the {EU directive on the Protection of Personal Data [3]/Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection [3]}. Two of those principles are Access and Notice. 

I would like to ask you for the following:

1. Under Access, I would like to get all the information associated to the deletion and moderation of my posts (including method used, logic, and timing information) in any of the courses I have participated in. I seek also to have information whether this moderation or deletion was automated, semi-automated or purely manual. 

2. Under Notice, please inform me of any data that might have been collected or computed about me. This includes any of the hundreds of A/B tests that I might have unknowingly participated in as a student. Under Notice, please also inform me of the logic followed to decide whether to include me or not in those experiments. This would include information about the ethical protocols followed by Coursera to decide whether and how to run this experimentation. I am assuming I would be informed on a case-by-case basis by universities when they decide to run their own experimentation (and in fact this has happened). This request also includes any information about the building of a "personality profile" [3], based on my interactions with the platform. 

3. Under Access, please provide me with all the information collected by the Coursera app, which I have installed on my smartphone at some point in 2015.

4. Under Access, please provide me with all the information collected for the purpose of identification and authentication for tests and quizzes on the platform. This would include keystroke biometrics and the associated processing, as well as pictures and the associated processing. 

5. Under Notice, please provide me with a listing of all the third parties that Coursera has shared or intends to share my data with, and the conditions that governed this transfer (a data policy, for instance). This would include confirmation or denial of any transfer or intent to transfer my data to law enforcement or intelligence services, confirmation or denial of any transfer or intent to transfer my data to for-profit or nonprofit universities, and confirmation or denial of any transfer or intent to transfer my data with potential investors or buyers of Coursera.

It is my understanding that Coursera has 40 days to comply with this request, which would bring us to January 4th 2016. Should you have any clarifying question, for instance about the scope of my requests, I would be happy to answer, but this would most likely eat into that time period. Should you fail to fully comply with this request, I reserve the right to use any or all possible avenues to exercise my rights.

Sincerely,

Paul-Olivier Dehaye
